                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                  These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the CyberCautionâ„¢ platform and related services (collectively, the "Service") provided by ERMITS LLC ("we", "our", or "us"). Please read these Terms carefully before using our Service.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the Terms, you may not access the Service.
                </p>

                <h2>Subscription and Accounts</h2>
                <h3>Account Registration</h3>
                <p>
                  When you create an account with us, you must provide accurate, complete, and current information. Failure to do so constitutes a breach of the Terms, which may result in immediate termination of your account.
                </p>

                <h3>Account Responsibility</h3>
                <p>
                  You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password. We encourage you to use "strong" passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols) with your account.
                </p>

                <h3>Subscription Terms</h3>
                <p>
                  Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis. You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select. At the end of each period, your subscription will automatically renew under the same conditions unless you cancel it or we cancel it.
                </p>

                <h3>Fee Changes</h3>
                <p>
                  We may, at our sole discretion and at any time, modify the subscription fees. Any subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current billing cycle. We will provide you with reasonable prior notice of any change in subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your subscription before such change becomes effective.
                </p>
